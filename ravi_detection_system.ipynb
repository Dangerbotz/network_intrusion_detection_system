    "### Describe the purpose of the data set you selected \n",
    "- *Why was this data collected in the first place?* - The data set selected is the \"UNSW_NB15\" network traffic data set. The data set was created to evalutate Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). According to the creators of the data set, N. Moustafa and J. Slay from the Australian Defence Force Academy, the \"quality of a NIDS data set reflects two important characteristics: comprehensive reflection of contemporary threats and an inclusive normal range of traffic [1].\" Before this data set was generated, they argued that existing data sets used to train and test NIDS were not representative of current traffic flows and threats.\n",
    "- Describe how you would define and measure the outcomes from the dataset. That is: \n",
    "    - *Why is this data important?* - The importance of this data set is that it will allow NIDS to be evaluted better, which will increase their performance, increase their protective power and reduce the chance of false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "    - *How do you know if you have mined useful knowledge from the dataset?* - We will know we mined useful knowledge from the data set if we can determine, based on a collection of packets of traffic data, whether the features of those packets indicate an attack or just normal traffic.\n",
    "    - *How would you measure the effectiveness of a good prediction algorithm? Be specific.* - Finding a model that predicts from the network traffic whether an attack is occuring or not, and, if there is an attack, which category of attack if occuring, will measure the effectiveness of the model. Determining if an attack is occuring is the basis of the model and with refinement, we will try to search for categorizing the attack."
